1. One chanllenge I faced was the coding of getting the sensor.
The breed board wouldn't connect with sensors at certain times. This is a problem im still facing.

2. Getting my pictures to show certain ones without repeating. I grouped the pictures based on the outfits and numbered them so I know what will show. This helped so the photos wont repeat.

3. Some of my photos show a little to big for the screen or too small. I have to resize them without all the pixels taking over the photo.
This is something I havent gotten to.
